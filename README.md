# ClockFIT
Inspiration
While making plans we always had to check more than two websites to find hours of various facilities such as clemente and aquatic center and contact them to make any reservations such as the Racquet ball room etc. Our plans would be like lets go for swimming - then check the hours in the website only to realize that the aquatic center is closed for the day and check the Clemente hours and find the phone number to make reservations for the Racquet ball room. To remove all this hassle we have brought things together.

What it does
It lists operational hours of all major facilities (11 of them) such as Holzer, Evan library, PDH etc and contact information for few important ones such as Holzer and CAPS.

How we built it
We built it in the Android studio using java and templates available in Android Studio.

Challenges we ran into
Deciding how to present the information and whether we need a database or not.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
First Android Application

What we learned
Got accustomed to android studio.

What's next for ClockFIT
Add webscraping functionality to pull the timings directly from websites
